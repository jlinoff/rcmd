OVERVIEW

  This release contains the rcmd.py tool which runs remote commands on
  one or more hosts using the SSH protocol, ancillary tools,
  documentation and examples. To see details about how to use rcmd.py,
  see the on line help (-h), read the HELP.txt and look at the
  examples.

  My motivation for developing and releasing this tool is that it has
  been so useful to me for system administration. I chose the GPLv3
  license to allow it to be disseminated as widely as possible.

INSTALLATION AND SETUP

  This tool does not need to be compiled, you can simply retrieve it
  from github or download it as a tarfile.

  The pubic git repo is https://github.com/jlinoff/rcmd.git.

  $ wget http://projects.joelinoff.com/rcmd/rcmd-1.0.tar.bz2
  $ tar jxf rcmd-1.0.tar.bz2

  You may have to install local support for python packages like
  argparse, paramiko or yaml. I tend to use a virtualenv and pip for
  this.

  After that you will want to create a login configuration file that
  contains host login information:

  $ ./rcmd-1.0/rcmd/bin/rcmd_edit_conf.sh login.conf
  Password:
  Confrm:

  The login configuration file is a YAML formatted file that is
  described in the HELP.txt file.
